# GitHubOracle Usage Guide

Quick reference for using GitHubOracle to query GitHub repository activity.

## Basic Command

```bash
ghoracle "your question here"
```

## Query Types

### 1. Specific PR Lookup

Ask about a specific pull request by number:

```bash
ghoracle "Tell me about PR #8127"
ghoracle "What is PR #123?"
ghoracle "Show me details of PR #456"
```

**What it does:** Fetches PR metadata including title, author, description, dates, and changes.

---

### 2. Author Queries

Find PRs by a specific person:

```bash
ghoracle "What did Alice ship last week?"
ghoracle "What has Bob worked on?"
ghoracle "Show me PRs by gkabbz"
```

**What it does:** Searches for PRs authored by the specified person, optionally filtered by time range.

---

### 3. Semantic Search

Find PRs by concept or topic:

```bash
ghoracle "Find PRs about database migrations"
ghoracle "Show me monitoring changes"
ghoracle "Find authentication-related PRs"
ghoracle "What performance improvements were made?"
```

**What it does:** Uses vector embeddings to find PRs semantically similar to your query, even if exact keywords don't match.

---

### 4. Directory/File Queries

Find PRs that changed specific directories or files:

```bash
ghoracle "What changed in the sql/ directory?"
ghoracle "Show PRs that modified config.yaml"
ghoracle "What happened in the tests/ folder?"
```

**What it does:** Filters PRs by files or directories they modified.

---

### 5. Reviewer Queries

Find PRs reviewed by someone:

```bash
ghoracle "What PRs did Alice review?"
ghoracle "Show me reviews by scholtzan"
```

**What it does:** Finds PRs where the specified person submitted a review.

---

### 6. Hybrid Queries

Combine filters with semantic search:

```bash
ghoracle "What authentication changes did Bob make?"
ghoracle "Find monitoring PRs by Alice"
ghoracle "Show database work from last month"
```

**What it does:** Applies both structured filters (author, date) AND semantic search (topic/concept).

---

## Time Ranges

Natural language time expressions work:

```bash
ghoracle "What shipped last week?"
ghoracle "Show PRs from yesterday"
ghoracle "What was merged last month?"
```

**Supported:** last week, yesterday, last month, last N days

---

## Advanced Options

### Verbose Mode

See what's happening under the hood:

```bash
python -m src.github_delivery.cli ask "your question" --verbose
```

Shows:
- Query plan generated by LLM
- SQL queries executed
- Number of results found
- Token usage and costs

### Specify Repository

Query a different repository:

```bash
python -m src.github_delivery.cli ask "your question" --repo mozilla/firefox
```

Default: `mozilla/bigquery-etl` (or whatever is set in your `.env`)

---

## Query Tips

### Be Specific
✅ Good: "What authentication changes did Alice make last week?"
❌ Vague: "What happened?"

### Use Natural Language
✅ Good: "Find PRs about database migrations"
❌ Too technical: "SELECT * WHERE body LIKE '%migration%'"

### Combine Filters
✅ Good: "What monitoring changes did Bob make?"
❌ Less useful: "Show me PRs" (too broad)

### Ask Follow-ups
After getting results, you can ask related questions:
```bash
ghoracle "Tell me about PR #8127"
# Read the answer, then:
ghoracle "Who reviewed this PR?"
ghoracle "What files did it change?"
```

---

## Common Questions

### "No PRs found matching your query"

**Possible reasons:**
- No PRs match your filters
- Date range is empty (e.g., "last week" but no PRs merged then)
- Author name misspelled
- Data not loaded into BigQuery yet

**Try:**
- Broaden your query: "What did Alice ship?" (remove time filter)
- Check spelling: "gkabbz" not "gkabz"
- Verify data exists: Check BigQuery tables

### "Error: API key required"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Should see:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# If missing, add it:
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
```

### "Command not found: ghoracle"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add to PATH in ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/gh-del-visibility"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify
which ghoracle
```
