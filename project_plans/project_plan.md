## 6. Risk Management

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **BigQuery vector search performance insufficient** | Low | Medium | Design allows migration to Vertex AI Vector Search |
| **LLM query quality poor** | Medium | High | Extensive prompt engineering, can switch providers |
| **Cost overruns** | Low | Medium | Implement caching, monitor costs daily |
| **Low user adoption** | Medium | High | Early user involvement, focus on time savings |
| **Data collection failures** | Low | Medium | Robust retry logic, monitoring alerts |
| **GitHub API rate limits** | Low | Low | Batch requests, respect rate limits |
| **Developer bandwidth** | Medium | Medium | Prioritize MVP, defer nice-to-haves |

### Risk Response Plans

**If BigQuery vector search is slow:**
- Phase 1: Accept slower responses (< 2 min OK for MVP)
- Phase 2: Optimize queries, add indexing
- Phase 3: Migrate to Vertex AI Vector Search (2-3 days effort)

**If LLM quality is poor:**
- Iterate on prompts (80% of quality issues)
- Add examples to prompts (few-shot learning)
- Switch to Claude Opus if needed (higher quality, higher cost)
- Last resort: Switch to manual SQL generation

**If costs exceed budget:**
- Implement aggressive caching (30-50% reduction)
- Reduce embedding frequency (weekly instead of daily)
- Switch from Claude to Gemini (75% cost reduction)
- Reduce query complexity

**If users don't adopt:**
- Conduct user interviews to understand barriers
- Simplify UX (reduce friction)
- Demonstrate time savings with metrics
- Provide more training/support
